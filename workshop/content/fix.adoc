=== Create Application On Primary

. *Create the Sample Application using ACM console.* +
Use the sample app example from https://github.com/RamenDR/ocm-ramen-samples to create a busybox deployment for failover and failback testing.
. *Validate Sample Application deployment.* +
Using CLI commands on both managed clusters validate that the application is running.
. *Apply DRPolicy to Sample Application.* +
Use the All Clusters Data Services UI to apply the new DRPolicy to the Sample Application. Once applied a DRPlacementControl resource will be created in the application namespace on the Hub cluster.
. *Failover Sample Application to secondary managed cluster.* +
Modify the application DRPlacementControl resource on the Hub Cluster, add the action of Failover and specify the failoverCluster to trigger the failover.
. *Failback Sample Application to primary managed cluster.* +
Modify the application DRPlacementControl resource on the Hub Cluster and change the action to Relocate to trigger a failback to the preferredCluster.

. Now you know how the DR works and how you can achieve Business Continuity for your application. Lets puts things to action now with troubleshooting an issue we have for an already configured sample application.
+
. Go to the {hub_openshift_cluster_console_url}/[OpenShift
console] and log in with your credentials username: {hub_openshift_cluster_admin_username} and password: {hub_openshift_cluster_admin_password}.
+
image:images/openshift-login.png[images/openshift-login.png]
. Upon successful login, you will see the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated environment. This is a kubernetes platform from which you can create containerized applications. Part of this environment is the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) platform along with Red Hat Openshift Disaster Recovery with ODF. To get started, you will need to access the RHACM plaftorm by clicking *local-cluster* from the left menu and then selecting *All Clusters*.
+
image:images/openshift-acm-menu.png[images/openshift-acm-menu.png]
. Upon clicking the *All Cluster* option, you will be redirected to the RHACM console displaying your available clusters.  There are 3 clusters available:
... local-cluster: This is your management cluster where you will create, failover and relocate your application.
... primary: Your main cluster where your applications are initially deployed to.
... secondary: Your backup cluster where your applications are failed over to.
+
image:images/rhacm-clusters.png[images/rhacm-clusters.png]
+
. You will now need to create your application which we will use in this workshop.  Click on *Applications* on the left menu and click *Create application->Subscription*
+
image:images/rhacm-create-application.png[images/rhacm-create-application.png]
. Once in the *Create application* wizard, enter the following details:
.. *Name*: globex
.. *Namespace*: globex
.. Under *Repository location for resources*:
... *Repository Types*: Git
... *URL*: https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/globex.git
... *Branch*: main
.. Under *Select clusters for application deployment*:
... Select *Deploy application resources on clusters with all specified labels*
.... *Label*: name
.... *Value*: primary
.. Your yaml on the right of your screen should look like this:

.. Click *Create* on the top right to create your application.  This should create an ACM application subscription which in turn creates a Helm release which will deploy your application to the primary cluster.
