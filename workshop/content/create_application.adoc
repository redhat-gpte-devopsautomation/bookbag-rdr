. Go to the %openshift_cluster_console_url%/[OpenShift
console] and log in with your credentials username: %openshift_cluster_admin_username% and password: %openshift_cluster_admin_password%.

. Upon successful login, you will see the Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated environment. This is a kubernetes platform from which you can create containerized applications. Part of this environment is the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) platform along with Red Hat Openshift Disaster Recovery with ODF. To get started, you will need to access the RHACM plaftorm by clicking *local-cluster* from the left menu and then selecting *All Clusters*.

. Upon clicking the *All Cluster* option, you will be redirected to the RHACM console displaying your available clusters.  There are 3 clusters available:
... local-cluster: This is your management cluster where you will create, failover and relocate your application.
... primary: Your main cluster where your applications are initially deployed to.
... secondary: Your backup cluster where your applications are failed over to.

. You will now need to create your application which we will use in this workshop.  Click on *Applications* on the left menu and click *Create application->Subscription*
+

. Once in the *Create application* wizard, enter the following details:
.. *Name*: globex
.. *Namespace*: globex
.. Under *Repository location for resources*:
... *Repository Types*: Git
... *URL*: https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/globex.git
... *Branch*: main
.. Under *Select clusters for application deployment*:
... Select *Deploy application resources on clusters with all specified labels*
.... *Label*: name
.... *Value*: primary
.. Your yaml on the right of your screen should look like this:
